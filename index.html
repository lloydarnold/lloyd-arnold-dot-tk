        <h1> A bit about me </h1>
        <p> Hi, I'm Lloyd, and I live on the South Coast. I've been writing code since I was
            12, and in the ensuing 6 years have developed a diverse skillset, in many
            fields within computing. Primarily, I'm a backend developer - I love sitting
            down and solving complex problems, whatever these may be. However, both of my
            parents studied at art school, and some of their talents have rubbed off on
            me and my front-end ability - I make crisp, simple and modern websites to suit
            a wide variety of needs.</p>
         <br>
         <ul>
           <li> Point one </li>
           <li> Point two </li>
           <li> Point three </li>
           <li> Point four </li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <p> With regards to my qualifications, I have GCSE and A level computer science,
             and have had several periods of work experience, including with Three Sided
             Cube, a web and app development firm based in Bournemouth. I have delivered
             every project I have worked on on time and on budget; I would love to work
             with you on your great idea. If you want to see more, you can check out my
             portfolio, <a href="web.html"> here</a>, or just get in touch,
             <a href="contact.html">here. </a> </p>
             <br>
        <p> Beyond Computer Science, I am a keen sportsman; I play hockey and rugby at
            at weekends, but when I'm not on the pitch you're likely to find me skating,
            or trying my hand at some watersports. </p>
